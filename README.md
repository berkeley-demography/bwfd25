[Peak Population Shiny App](https://berkeley-demog.shinyapps.io/peak_pop_shiny/)

Another way to run the app is to open the shiny/peak_pop_shiny folder in [Datahub](https://workshop.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fberkeley-demography%2Fbwfd25&urlpath=rstudio%2F&branch=main) opening either server.R or ui.R and clicking on the 'Run App' button in Rstudio.
